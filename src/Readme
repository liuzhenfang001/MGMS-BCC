## Algorithms
This repository contains some batch algorithms(MGMS-BCC, MG-BCC, MS-BCC) for computing closeness centrality in uncertain graph. MGMS-BCC, MG-BCC and MS-BCC implement techniques proposed in "Closeness Centrality on Uncertain Graphs" (TWEB 23). 


## The format of the dataset
1. The information file of dataset file is in file "./test_queries"
# The format of dataset's information file "XXX.txt" is
[ID] [path of datasets] [reference]

    # For example: the content of information file "test.txt" is
    1 test_queries/data/test.txt BFS-Sharing


2. The dataset file is in file "./test_queries/data"
# The format of dataset file "XXX.txt" is
# FromNodeId|ToNodeId
u1|v1
u2|v2
...

Where the u1,u2,..., and v1,v2,... are vertices. 


## Complie Commend
make


## Run Commend
[executaion file] [datasets file] [number of execution times] [number of thread] [Type of algorithm] [multiples of 64] [number of source vertices] f

The file for parameter [datasets file] is a list of vertex pairs(u v) representing the edges in the graph.
The parameter [number of execution times] refers to the number of times the algorithm is run.
The parameter [Type of algorithm] refers to the type of algorithm. Optional are MGMS-BCC, MG-BCC, MS-BCC, MGMS-BCC-unOPT, baseline. Where MGMS-BCC is the default optimized MGMS-BCC algorithm, MGMS-BCC-unOPT refers to the unoptimized MGMS-BCC algorithm and baseline is the BasicBCC algorithm mentioned in the paper.
The parameter [multiples of 64] refers to setting the MG-BCC to run 64 * [multiples of 64] BFS in parallel.
The parameter f instructs the computer to force the algorithm to run.

For example:
-----------------------------------------------
./runBencher ./test_queries/test.txt 1 1 MGMS-BCC 1 5 f
./runBencher ./test_queries/test.txt 2 8 MGMS-BCC 1 8 f
./runBencher ./test_queries/Slash.txt 1 1 MGMS-BCC 1 1000 f
./runBencher ./test_queries/Slash.txt 1 1 MG-BCC 1 1000 f
-----------------------------------------------


## Output
[datasets file] [total time] [BFS time] [sample time] [number of source vertices] [sample number] [thread number] [algorithm name] [number of getting neighbors] [number of getting states]

The parameter [number of getting neighbors] refers to the total number of vertex neighbors that the algorithm gets.
The parameter [number of getting states] refers to the total number of vector "states" viewed by the algorithm.
